Red-Giant-Simulator
===================

A simulation of the Sun's evolution to the red giant stage of its lifecycle. Written in Fortran 95 for a BSc final year project.
This project is a historical piece I have uploaded for demonstration purposes, it has not been recompiled on a modern FORTRAN
implementation, instead it simply contains the original document with the program in the appendices.
